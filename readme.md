# nvim

My NeoVim configuration

## Usage

As long as NeoVim is installed soundly, simply run the following commands...

```shell
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:vehmloewff/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim

# install packer
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

... then start NeoVim and run `:PackerSync`. Once everything is installed, exit and start again.
